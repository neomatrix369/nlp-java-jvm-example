Run a docker container with Apache OpenNLP written in Java, running under the traditional Java 8 (from OpenJDK or another source) or GraalVM.

Find out more about [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) from the [NLP section](../../../../../natural-language-processing/README.md#natural-language-processing-nlp) section.

Startup in traditional JDK or GraalVM mode.

## Goals

- Download and install the Apache OpenNLP tool
- (optional) Switch to GraalVM (polyglot JVM i.e. GraalVM JDK Community version from Oracle Labs)
- Run a number of NLP actions to explore the Apache OpenNLP tool

## Scripts provided

**Go to [the previous folder](../opennlp) to find the below scripts.**

- [opennlp.sh](./opennlp.sh): download and install the Apache OpenNLP tool into the `shared` folder
- [detectLanguage.sh](./detectLanguage.sh): Detecting language in a single line text or article (see [legend of language abbreviations](https://www.apache.org/dist/opennlp/models/langdetect/1.8.3/README.txt) used).
- [detectSentence.sh](./detectSentence.sh): Detecting sentences in a single line text or article.
- [nameFinder.sh](./nameFinder.sh): Finding person name, organization name, date, time, money, location, percentage information in a single line text or article.
- [tokenizer.sh](./tokenizer.sh): Tokenise a line of text or an article into itâ€™s smaller components (i.e. words, punctuation, numbers).
- [parser.sh](./parser.sh): Parse a line of text or an article and identify groups of words or phrases that go together (see [Penn Treebank tag set](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html) for legend of token types).
- [posTagger.sh](./posTagger.sh): Tag parts of speech of each token in a line of text or an article (see [Penn Treebank tag set](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html) for legend of token types), also see https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml.
- [chunker.sh](./chunker.sh): Text chunking by dividing a text or an article into syntactically correlated parts of words, like noun groups, verb groups. You apply this feature on the tagged parts of speech text or article. Apply chunking on a text already tagged by PoS tagger. Also see https://nlpforhackers.io/text-chunking/.

All the above check if the respective model(s) exist and downloads them accordingly into the `shared` folder.

## Exploring NLP concepts

### Detecting language

Usage:

```bash
$ ./detectLanguage.sh
```

```
No parameter has been passed. Please see usage below:

       Usage: ./detectLanguage.sh --text [text]
                 --file [path/to/filename]
                 --help

       --text      plain text surrounded by quotes
       --file      name of the file containing text to pass as command arg
       --help      shows the script usage help text
```

Examples:

```bash
$ ./detectLanguage.sh --text "This is an english sentence"

Checking if model langdetect-183.bin exists...
Found model langdetect-183.bin
Loading Language Detector model ... done (1.836s)
eng This is an english sentence



Average: 26.3 doc/s
Total: 1 doc
Runtime: 0.038s
Execution time: 2.221 seconds

Check out https://www.apache.org/dist/opennlp/models/langdetect/1.8.3/README.txt to find out what each of the two-letter language indicators mean
```

Similarly a file containing text can be passed in as:

```bash
$ ./detectLanguage.sh --file article.txt
```

### Detecting sentences

Usage: 
```bash
$ ./detectSentence.sh
```

```
No parameter has been passed. Please see usage below:

       Usage: ./detectSentence.sh --text [text]
                 --file [path/to/filename]
                 --help

       --text      plain text surrounded by quotes
       --file      name of the file containing text to pass as command arg
       --help      shows the script usage help text
```

Examples:

```bash
$ ./detectSentence.sh --text "This is an english sentence. And this is another sentence."
Checking if model en-sent.bin (en) exists...
Found model en-sent.bin (en)
Loading Sentence Detector model ... done (0.137s)
This is an english sentence.
And this is another sentence.



Average: 117.6 sent/s
Total: 2 sent
Runtime: 0.017s
Execution time: 0.414 seconds
```

Similarly a file containing text can be passed in as:

```bash
$ ./detectSentence.sh --file article.txt
```

Note: if you miss out sentence ending delimeters (like a period ==> .) then it considers the whole text as a sentence till it finds the next delimeter terminating the sentence.

### Finding names

Usage: 

```bash
$ ./nameFinder.sh
```

```
No parameter has been passed. Please see usage below:

       Usage: ./nameFinder.sh --method [ person | location | date | time | money | organization | percentage ]
                 --text [text]
                 --file [path/to/filename]
                 --help
       --method    [ person | location | date | time | money | organization | percentage ]
                     person       - find name of persons in text
                     location     - find location names in text
                     date         - find dates mentioned in text
